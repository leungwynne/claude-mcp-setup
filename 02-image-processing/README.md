# üñºÔ∏è Image-to-Scene Object Reverse Engineering System

## **Purpose**
Automatically analyze existing images through ChatGPT to extract detailed scene objects and text prompts for building our comprehensive database.

## **Workflow**

### **1. Image Preparation**
- Place images in: `02-image-processing/input-images/`
- Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`
- Name images descriptively for better organization

### **2. Automated Processing** 
- Start new ChatGPT conversation (never mention automation/Claude)
- Upload image to ChatGPT
- Request structured scene object analysis
- Extract JSON scene object and text prompt
- Save results to database

### **3. Database Integration**
- Processed data saved to: `01-data-libraries/scene-objects/reverse-engineered/`
- Individual JSON files with full metadata
- Automatic categorization and quality scoring
- Integration with existing SQLite database

## **ChatGPT Prompt Template**

```
I need you to analyze this image and provide two outputs:

1. **DETAILED SCENE OBJECT**: Create a comprehensive JSON scene object that captures every technical and creative detail needed to recreate this exact image. Include:
   - Camera settings and technical specifications
   - Lighting setup (type, direction, intensity, color temperature)
   - Subject details (pose, expression, wardrobe, props)
   - Environment description (location, background, architectural elements)
   - Composition and framing details
   - Color grading and post-processing notes
   - Any special effects or techniques used

2. **CHATGPT DALL-E PROMPT**: Create the hyperspecific text prompt that ChatGPT would use internally when sending instructions to DALL-E to recreate this exact image. Format it exactly as ChatGPT would structure it for its own image generation system, including all technical specifications and visual details that DALL-E needs.

Please structure the scene object as a properly formatted JSON with clear hierarchical organization. Be as technically precise as possible - imagine a photographer needs to recreate this exact image from your description.

Format your response like this:

**SCENE OBJECT:**
```json
{
  // Your detailed scene object here
}
```

**CHATGPT DALL-E PROMPT:**
```
Your hyperspecific DALL-E prompt here (exactly as ChatGPT would format it)
```

**TECHNICAL NOTES:**
Any additional observations or technical considerations
```

## **Folder Structure**

```
02-image-processing/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input-images/          # Place images here for processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processed-results/     # Processing plans and intermediate results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image-to-scene-processor.js  # Main automation script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

## **Database Integration**

Processed scene objects are automatically:
- Categorized (portrait, product, landscape, macro, lifestyle, general)
- Quality scored (1-10 based on completeness and detail)
- Saved as individual JSON files
- Ready for SQLite database insertion

## **Usage Example**

1. Place image: `input-images/professional-headshot-01.jpg`
2. Run automation in new chat
3. ChatGPT analyzes and provides scene object + text prompt
4. Results saved to: `01-data-libraries/scene-objects/reverse-engineered/reverse-professional-headshot-01-2025-07-14.json`

## **Quality Metrics**

- **Completeness**: All technical specifications captured
- **Accuracy**: Precise recreation details
- **Usability**: Clear implementation guidance
- **Integration**: Seamless database compatibility

## **Next Steps**

After processing images:
1. Review generated scene objects for accuracy
2. Update database with new entries
3. Analyze patterns for prompt optimization
4. Build comprehensive scene object library
